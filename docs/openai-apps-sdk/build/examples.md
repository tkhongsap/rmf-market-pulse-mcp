# Apps SDK Examples Documentation

**Source:** https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/build/examples

## Overview

The documentation introduces the **Pizzaz demo app**, which the site describes as bundling "a handful of UI components so you can see the full tool surface area end-to-end."

## Key Information

The page indicates that:

- **Purpose**: These examples serve as templates for developers building their own applications
- **Location**: The Pizzaz demo and additional examples are housed in the [OpenAI apps SDK examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples)
- **Content Structure**: The documentation walks developers through both the MCP server architecture and the component implementations that power the tools

## Navigation Context

The examples page sits within a broader Apps SDK documentation structure that covers:
- Planning phase (use cases, tools, components)
- Building phase (MCP servers, custom UX, authentication, state management)
- Deployment phase (integration and testing)

## Access

To view complete code samples and implementation details, developers should reference the GitHub examples repository linked in the documentation, as the webpage itself primarily provides an overview and guidance rather than displaying full code implementations.
