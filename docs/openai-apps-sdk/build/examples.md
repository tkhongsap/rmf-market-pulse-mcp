# Apps SDK Examples

## Overview

The page introduces end-to-end examples for the Apps SDK, specifically highlighting the "Pizzaz demo app" as a comprehensive reference implementation. According to the content, this demonstration application "bundles a handful of UI components so you can see the full tool surface area end-to-end."

## Key Resources

The documentation directs developers to the official GitHub repository for example implementations. The page notes that "the following sections walk through the MCP server and the component implementations that power those tools."

## Purpose

These examples serve as blueprints for developers building their own applications. The resource emphasizes learning from existing implementations to understand:

- MCP server architecture
- Component-based UI implementation
- Full end-to-end functionality

## Navigation

The page is part of the broader Apps SDK documentation structure, with the previous section covering state management functionality.
