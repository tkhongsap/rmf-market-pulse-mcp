# Apps SDK - OpenAI Developers

## Overview

The Apps SDK represents OpenAI's framework for developing applications that extend ChatGPT's functionality. Currently in preview, it enables developers to build and test apps with plans for formal submission later in the year.

## Getting Started

The documentation provides three primary pathways:

**Launch Your First App** - The quickstart guide walks developers through creating and connecting their inaugural app to ChatGPT.

**Plan Phase** - This involves researching use cases and identifying appropriate Applications SDK applications.

**Build & Deploy** - Developers wire together tools, templates, and widget runtime components, then deploy their MCP servers.

## Core Documentation Sections

### Foundational Concepts
- MCP Server architecture
- User interaction patterns
- Design guidelines native to ChatGPT

### Development Process
- Use case research
- Tool definition
- Component design
- Custom UX development
- User authentication
- State management
- Code examples

### Deployment & Testing
- Server deployment procedures
- ChatGPT integration connection
- Integration testing

## Quality Standards

Two key resource documents guide development:

**App Design Guidelines** - Establish how components and conversational flows should feel integrated within ChatGPT's environment.

**App Developer Guidelines** - Outline quality, safety, and policy requirements developers must meet.

## Additional Resources

Guides address three critical areas:

- Metadata optimization for improved discoverability
- Security and privacy considerations
- Troubleshooting common implementation issues

The documentation emphasizes building applications that maintain ChatGPT's native feel while providing robust functionality and security practices.
