# Apps SDK Examples

## Overview

The documentation page introduces end-to-end examples for the Apps SDK, with the "Pizzaz demo app" as the primary reference implementation. This demo showcases "a handful of UI components so you can see the full tool surface area."

The page directs developers to the [examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/openai-apps-sdk-examples) for access to sample implementations and other reference projects.

## Purpose

These examples serve as "blueprints when you assemble your own app," providing practical patterns for building applications using the Apps SDK.

## Navigation Context

The page appears within the broader Apps SDK documentation structure, positioned after the "Manage state" section in the Build phase of the development workflow. The documentation covers:

- **Core Concepts** (MCP Server, User interaction, Design guidelines)
- **Planning** (Use cases, Tools, Components)
- **Building** (Server setup, Custom UX, Authentication, State management)
- **Deployment** (App deployment, ChatGPT integration, Testing)
- **Guides** (Metadata optimization, Security & Privacy, Troubleshooting)

The page serves as a practical continuation of the foundational building blocks covered in earlier sections.
